## 2.0.0

`2016-09-28`

After four months, `antd@2.0.0` is published. We had refactored code and improve functionalities and details of existing components. What's more, we provide English version of the documentation. The antd community help us a lot in developing `antd@2.0.0`.

If you meet any problem while you try to upgrade from `antd@1.0.0`, feel free to [create issues on GitHub](https://github.com/antFB/antFB/issues).

### 2.x Major changes

* Refactor components with TypeScript, and provide **`.d.ts` files which are officially supported**. Thanks to all the developers that contributed to [#1846](https://github.com/antFB/antFB/issues/1846) and @infeng.
* **Translate the documentation into English**, and we are going to provide both of Chinese and English versions of the documentation in the future. Thanks to all the translators and reviewers that contributed to [#1471](https://github.com/antFB/antFB/issues/1471).
* DatePicker, TimePicker, Calendar and other components that are designed to select time **are refactored to replace [gregorian-calendar](github.com/yiminghe/gregorian-calendar) with [moment](http://momentjs.com/)**.
* All the [icons](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/components/icon/) are re-designed.
* New component [Mention](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/components/mention/).
* New component [AutoComplete](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/components/auto-complete/).
* The `getFieldProps` of Form is replaced with `getFieldDecorator` which will warn developers if they make mistakes. Related discussion [#1533](https://github.com/antFB/antFB/issues/1533).
* Table supports [grouping columns](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/components/table/#components-table-demo-grouping-columns). @yesmeck
* Removed components and features which are deprecated in `antd@1.x`, such as QueueAnim, Validation, Form.ValueMixin, Progress.Line, Progress.Circle, Popover[overlay] and Slider[marks] will not support array any more.

### 2.x Breaking changes

There are some breaking changes in `antd@2.0.0`, and you need to modify your code to work with it.

* `value` and `defaultValue` of all the time-related components will not support type `String/Date`, please use [moment](http://momentjs.com/):
  ```diff
  - <TimePicker defaultValue="12:08:23" />
  + <TimePicker defaultValue={moment('12:08:23', 'HH:mm:ss')} />

  - <DatePicker defaultValue="2015/01/01" />
  + <DatePicker defaultValue={moment('2015/01/01', 'YYYY/MM/DD')} />

  - <Calendar defaultValue={new Date('2010-10-10')} />
  + <Calendar defaultValue={moment('2010-10-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD')} />
  ```
* Parameters of type `Date/GregorianCalendar` of functions such as `onChange` and `onPanelChange`, plus other callback functions had been changed to type moment. Please consult [APIs of gregorian-calendar](https://github.com/yiminghe/gregorian-calendar) and [APIs of moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/), and update your code accordingly. Because the return value of `JSON.stringy(date: moment)` will lost time zone, we should use `.format` to convert date to string first, see related issue [#3082](https://github.com/antFB/antFB/issues/3082) for details:
  ```js
  handleSubmit() {
    const values = this.props.form.getFieldsValue();
    values.date = values.date.format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss'); // or other format
    const data = JSON.stringify(values);
    // send data to server
  }
  ```
* The `format` of time-related components is changed from [gregorian-calendar-format](https://github.com/yiminghe/gregorian-calendar-format#api) to [moment  format](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) now, for instance the format `yyyy-MM-dd` should change to `YYYY-MM-DD`.
* `linkRender` and `nameRender` of Breadcrumb are removed, please use `itemRender`.
* `onClose` and `onOpen` of Menu are removed, please use `onOpenChange`. As being totally different, please check [this demo](http://beta.ant.design/components/menu/#components-menu-demo-sider-current) first.
* Paging columns of Table were removed, please use [fixed columns](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/components/table/#components-table-demo-fixed-columns).

The following change will throw some warnings in the console and it will still work, but we recommend to update your code.

* `getFieldProps` of Form is deprecated, please use `getFieldDecorator`:

  ```diff
  -  <Input placeholder="text" {...getFieldProps('userName', { ... })} />
  +  {getFieldDecorator('userName', { ... })(
  +    <Input placeholder="text" />
  +  )}
  ```

* `toggleOpen` of DatePicker is deprecated, please use `onOpenChange`:

  ```diff
  - handleToggleOpen({ open }) {
  + handleOpenChange(open) {
    ...
  }
  ```

### 2.x Workflow

* [AntD Library](http://library.ant.design/) a collection of Axure files which includes components and patterns that follow Ant Fable Specification.
* Rename `babel-plugin-antd` to [`babel-plugin-import`](https://github.com/ant-design/babel-plugin-import), and this means that `babel-plugin-import` becomes an common load-on-demand solution and not just for `antd`.

  Please update `package.json`:

  ```diff
  {
    "devDependencies": {
  -   "babel-plugin-antd": "^0.x.x",
  +   "babel-plugin-import": "^1.0.0",
    }
  }
  ```

  And update your babel config in `.babelrc` or other place:

  ```diff
  {
  -  "plugins": [["antd", { style: "css" }]]
  +  "plugins": [["import", { libraryName: "antd", style: "css" }]]
  }
  ```

* [dva@1.0.0](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) is published and it is officially recommended framework [in real world](http://diy-design.me/n.html?%2F&port=8001/docs/react/practical-projects).
* The officially recommended scaffold is [dva-cli](https://github.com/dvajs/dva-cli) now, the old `antd-init` is just for studying and demo.
